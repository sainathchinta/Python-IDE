To execute any program or code we need an Integrated Development Environment that is IDE. IDE is an environment where we can write any program or code to execute it and display itâ€™s output. So in this post we are going to learn that how we can create our own IDE using a built-in python library that is tkinter and subprocess.

module required:
1)tkinter

4)filedialog

This IDE contains two widgets one is for to receive input code and other is print output.
